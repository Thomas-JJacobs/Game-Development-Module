Brief Game Description:
The games intention and purpose is to be a form of arcade-sidescroller,
inspired by the games "Run", "Run-2" and "Temple Run".

The game is set in a "dungeon", "castle" environment; where the player is tasked with 
just one goal... Proceed to the next level in order to escape the castle. This is of-
course, if it where only as simple as that. During the level you will have to constantly
out run a armoured wall as well as land on a variety of platforms which individal mechanics
/mechanisms grow as you proceed through the levels. As a player you will be challenged and 
aided by the use of a variety of in game actors / components... Good Luck! :)
